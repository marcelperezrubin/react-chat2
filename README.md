# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a chat application created with React - Vite - Socket, In this chat you can write and the other 
persons that have the link can answer you and start an conversation, the person who uses the browser will have the
username "me" by default this is to differentiate from the other person, some features to highlight about this chat are that once you refresh your browser the conversation is deleted, the design has been made with tailwind-css, It has an openweathermap api, to know the current weather in London.

# Enjoy !
