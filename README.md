# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a chat application created with React - Vite - Socket. In this chat, you can write, and other individuals with the link can respond to you and initiate a conversation. The person using the browser will have the username "me" by default, which helps differentiate them from others. Notably, once you refresh your browser, the conversation is deleted. The design has been crafted with tailwind-css. It also integrates the openweathermap API to provide the current weather in London. Additionally, if you're using a Mac, you can use emojis by pressing the fn key.

Furthermore, users have the capability to create a group chatroom and post messages within the group. Each message is only displayed in the specific group where it has been posted.

# Enjoy !
